This plugin was developed for my most awesome wife and her wordpress site.

We needed a way to add statistics for a local area.  The administrator
of the wordpress site can manually update the statistics each year
for thier local areas.  Generally these are pulled from local MLS 
systems.

The charting component used is AMCharts, it is awesome and totally html5 ready.
